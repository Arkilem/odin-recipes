		<p>Dijon salmon is a flavorful and healthy dish that combines the rich taste of salmon with tangy Dijon mustard. To make Dijon salmon, the fish is typically marinated in a mixture of Dijon mustard, honey, lemon juice, and garlic before being baked or grilled.

Dijon salmon is often served with a side of roasted vegetables, such as asparagus or broccoli, and a simple salad.</p>
