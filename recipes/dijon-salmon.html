		<p>Dijon salmon is a flavorful and healthy dish that combines the rich taste of salmon with tangy Dijon mustard. To make Dijon salmon, the fish is typically marinated in a mixture of Dijon mustard, honey, lemon juice, and garlic before being baked or grilled. The result is a dish that is both flavorful and tender, with a slightly crispy exterior and moist, juicy interior. Dijon salmon is often served with a side of roasted vegetables, such as asparagus or broccoli, and a simple salad.</p>
		<p>One of the benefits of Dijon salmon is that it is a nutritious and high-protein dish that is also low in calories and fat. Salmon is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation. Additionally, the Dijon mustard used in this dish is low in calories but high in flavor, making it a great alternative to heavier sauces or dressings. Overall, Dijon salmon is a delicious and healthy way to enjoy the many benefits of this popular fish.</p>
