		<p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup</p>
		<p>Miso ramen soup is a popular Japanese dish that combines the flavors of miso paste with savory broth and noodles. The soup typically features a hearty broth made from pork bones, chicken, or vegetables, along with a mix of miso paste and soy sauce. The noodles used in miso ramen are typically curly and slightly thicker than other types of ramen noodles, which helps them absorb the rich, savory broth. Common toppings for miso ramen include sliced pork, green onions, bean sprouts, and boiled eggs, though there are many variations that incorporate different meats, vegetables, and seasonings.</p>
